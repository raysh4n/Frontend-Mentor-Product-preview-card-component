## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

- With `max-width` or height and `background-image:cover` being set, when you resize, the image will be cropped along the way too. Because the width will keep changing when window being resized.  

- set the photo height to 43rem is important in this case.
